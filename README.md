# Forms in Redux

This is a proof-of-concept for form management in Redux.

Each branch has a different feature:

 * ```form-notification```: page-level notifications based on form validations.
 * ```form-prefill```: form pre-population using redux-saga's event channels.
 * ```form-validation```: form validation using middlewares.
 * ```master```: all features, merged.
 * ```vanilla```: nothing, it's a vanilla form.
