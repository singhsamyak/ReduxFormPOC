# Forms in Redux

This is a proof-of-concept for form management in Redux.

Each branch has a different concept:

 * ```vanilla```: nothing, it's a vanilla form.
 * ```form-validation```: simple form validation using middlewares.
 * ```form-prefill```: simple form pre-population using event-channels (redux-saga).
 * ```master```: all, merged.
